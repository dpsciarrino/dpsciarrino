ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dom! You can reach me at: dominic.sciarrino@gmail.com. My interest is in automation, web application development, and data analysis. For fun, I like to hike and travel when possible. I've played guitar since I was 8 and have played in various bands ever since. I also speak Italian at a B2 level. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

<h2>Zeal</h2>

GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Prakshal-Jain/Zeal">https://github.com/Prakshal-Jain/Zeal</a>

<p>This was a project I worked on with a group of fellow students at the University at Buffalo. The idea was to build a web application that aided Hack-a-thon organizers and participants to efficently match those who had project ideas with others that have the relevant experience to realize the project.</p>

<p>The technologies used to make Zeal include: ReactJS for the frontend, Django for the backend, and Postgres as the database management system. We used a watered-down Agile management methodology throughout the course, with weekly meetings with a project leader. Everything was kept track of in ZenHub and GitHub was used for version control. Deployment was done using free services from Heroku.</p>
