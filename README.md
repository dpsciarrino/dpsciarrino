ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dom! You can reach me at: dominic.sciarrino@gmail.com. My interest is in automation, web application development, and data analysis. For fun, I like to hike and travel when possible. I also speak Italian at a B2 level. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

<h1>Projects</h1>

<h2>Micro800 PLC I/O Development Tool</h2>

GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/dpsciarrino/Micro800_IO_Development_Tool">https://github.com/dpsciarrino/Micro800_IO_Development_Tool</a>

<p>A useful tool written with the Python Django web framework for configuring Micro800 digital I/O tags for development and testing purposes.</p>

<h2>Verbigo</h2>

Site: <a href="http://dpsciarr.pythonanywhere.com/">Verbigo</a>

<p>A Django site created as a result of web scraping Italian verb conjugations for language practice. Stored all verb conjugation data into a SQLite database. Then, I developed this Djago site and integrated the verb data into the Django database as models.</p>

<h2>KiCAD Automation</h2>

GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/dpsciarrino/kicad_auto">https://github.com/dpsciarrino/kicad_auto</a>

<p>For Mimmotronics Effects I develop guitar pedal modification and effects circuits, for which I use KiCAD design software. This project allows me to streamline my workflow for project creation. It uses a combination of Python scripts and Makefile commands.</p>

<h2>Zeal</h2>

GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Prakshal-Jain/Zeal">https://github.com/Prakshal-Jain/Zeal</a>

<p>This was a project I worked on with a group of fellow students at the University at Buffalo. The idea was to build a web application that aided Hack-a-thon organizers and participants to efficently match those who had project ideas with others that have the relevant experience to realize the project.</p>

<p>The technologies used to make Zeal include: ReactJS for the frontend, Django for the backend, and Postgres as the database management system. We used a watered-down Agile management methodology throughout the course, with weekly meetings with a project leader. Everything was kept track of in ZenHub and GitHub was used for version control. Deployment was done using free services from Heroku.</p>
