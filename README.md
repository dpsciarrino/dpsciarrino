ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dom! You can reach me at: dominic.sciarrino@gmail.com.

Professionally, my interest is in data analysis and web application development. I have experience with NumPy and the Pandas framework for data analysis, and BeautifulSoup and RegEx for web scraping. For web development, my main experience is with the Flask framework, HTML5/CSS3, Bootstrap, and Postgresql and SQLite relational database management. I've also used Django alongside ReactJS for a university group project called <a href="https://github.com/Prakshal-Jain/Zeal">Zeal</a>.

For fun, I like to travel and hike when I can. I've played guitar since I was 8 and have played in various bands since high school. I also speak Italian. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
