ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dom! You can reach me at: dominic.sciarrino@gmail.com. Professionally, my interest is in data analysis and web application development. For fun, I like to travel and hike when I can. I've played guitar since I was 8 and have played in various bands since high school. I also speak Italian. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

<h1>Projects</h1>

<h2>Italian Verb Web Scrapers</h2>

GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/dpsciarrino/italian-verb-scrapers">https://github.com/dpsciarrino/italian-verb-scrapers</a>

<p>My main intention with this project was to learn how to use the Beautiful Soup python library. I used a SQLite database to store data on Italian verb conjugations and other useful information. I'm planning on using the data collected from this project in other projects <em>soon</em>.</p>

<h2>KiCAD Automation</h2>

<p>For Mimmotronics Effects I develop guitar pedal modification and effects circuits, for which I use KiCAD design software. This project allows me to streamline my workflow for project creation. It uses a combination of Python scripts and Makefile commands.</p>

<h2>Zeal</h2>

<p>This was a project I worked on with a group of fellow students at the University at Buffalo. The idea was to build a web application that aided Hack-a-thon organizers and participants to efficently match those who had project ideas with others that have the relevant experience to realize the project.</p>

<p>The technologies used to make Zeal include: ReactJS for the frontend, Django for the backend, and Postgres as the database management system. We used a watered-down Agile management methodology throughout the course, with weekly meetings with a project leader. Everything was kept track of in ZenHub and GitHub was used for version control. Deployment was done using free services from Heroku.</p>
