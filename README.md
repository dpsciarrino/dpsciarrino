ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dom! You can reach me at: dominic.sciarrino@gmail.com. My interest is in automation, web application development, and data analysis. For fun, I like to travel and hike when I can. I've played guitar since I was 8 and have played in various bands since high school. I also speak Italian at a B2 level. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹

<h1>Projects</h1>

<h2>Verbigo</h2>

<p>Verbigo is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application for practicing italian verb conjugations. Register as a user, login, and start creating 'stacks' of verbs to practice. You can edit the stack at any time, along with the verb list. You can even have multiple stacks, so you can organize the verbs into categories if that helps. If you don't want a stack anymore, you can delete it. There are currently six (6) verb tenses to choose from, and you can choose whether to display pronouns in english or italian during the practice sessions.

The web application is built using Django Python Framework, with custom CSS.</p>

<h2>KiCAD Automation</h2>

<p>For Mimmotronics Effects I develop guitar pedal modification and effects circuits, for which I use KiCAD design software. This project allows me to streamline my workflow for project creation. It uses a combination of Python scripts and Makefile commands.</p>

<h2>Zeal</h2>

<p>This was a project I worked on with a group of fellow students at the University at Buffalo. The idea was to build a web application that aided Hack-a-thon organizers and participants to efficently match those who had project ideas with others that have the relevant experience to realize the project.</p>

<p>The technologies used to make Zeal include: ReactJS for the frontend, Django for the backend, and Postgres as the database management system. We used a watered-down Agile management methodology throughout the course, with weekly meetings with a project leader. Everything was kept track of in ZenHub and GitHub was used for version control. Deployment was done using free services from Heroku.</p>
