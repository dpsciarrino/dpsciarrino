ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Dom. To put it simply, I like building things.

My interests are in industrial automation, web application development, and data analysis. Iâ€™m currently on a steady path towards building a portfolio of independent websites, mostly using the Django framework.

At the moment, Iâ€™m working on a web application for learning Italian verb conjugations, and plan to have an alpha version up and running by the end of 2022.

I have Dual-Citizenship in the US and Italy, speak fluent English, and I have a working proficiency in the Italian language.

I also manage/operate Mimmotronics Effects, which provides guitar effects modification services and hand-built products for the DIY guitar effects community.

Feel free to reach out! The best way is through e-mail: dominic.sciarrino@gmail.com.
